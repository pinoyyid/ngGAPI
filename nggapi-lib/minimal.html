    <title>The simplest possible example. Display a list of Drive files.</title>

    This is a sample app showing how simple it is to access Drive using ngGapi. In this case it is listing all drive files containing xxx in the title.<br>
    All of the code is in minimal.html. When I say "all of the code", it's only two lines!!! How cool is that.
    <li ng-repeat="file in vm.filesArray">{{file.title}}</li>
